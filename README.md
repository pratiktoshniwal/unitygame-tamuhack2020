Idea: VR exercise environment with virtual pet/avatar coach

Reasoning:  The VR space is limitless in what experiences it can expose people to and what they can do in the environments it generates.
            Exercising is usually reduced to confined spaces with limited entertainment of which usually has nothing to do with the
            exercise taking place. Our objective is to provide users with environments and settings that the user will feel most
            appropriate and comfortable exercising in as well as a pet/coach to demonstrate exercises, exercise with them, inform the user
            how they're doing, and encourage/make recommendations to the user.
